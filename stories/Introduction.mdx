------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project was to implement a table in a declarative style to work with the react-pdf library.

  **Note:** You should not use TableRow directly.

Below is a description of the different components. The text in brackets indicates what the most similar HTML element would be.        

A Table (table) is the main container. This generally passes the data down into the components.
The TableHeader (th) contains the title columns, each column is defined by the TableCell (td) children.
The TableBody (tr) contains how the rows need to be displayed. Each column is defined by the DataTableCell (td) children.
